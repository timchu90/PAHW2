Crews are continuing to search for a woman officials say intentionally went overboard from a cruise ship that had been chartered for an electronic dance party.

The U.S. Coast Guard and officials from Norwegian Cruise Line say the woman went overboard from a deck of the Norwegian Pearl around 7 p.m. Thursday as the ship was about 22 miles off the coast of Cuba.

The cruise line said in a news release Friday that the cruise was chartered for the Mad Decent Boat Party event. It was advertised as an "insane" event with performers including Diplo and Skrillex, sailing from Miami to Cozumel from Wednesday to Sunday.

Officials say the woman was observed "intentionally going overboard while the ship was sailing the Yucatan Channel." No name has been released.
