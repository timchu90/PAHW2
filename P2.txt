Republican presidential contender Ben Carson is firing back at Donald Trump this morning, responding to Trump's attacks on Carson's "pathological stories" by saying the New York real estate mogul needs to learn the definition of pathological.

"Someone needs to tell him what pathological really means," Carson told Yahoo's Katie Couric.

Trump on Carson Stories: 'How Stupid Are the People of Iowa to Believe This Crap'
The battle between the two candidates, who are leading the race for the GOP nomination, intensified after Trump compared Carson to a “child molester” and asked Thursday night "how stupid are the people of Iowa to believe this crap?"

Lashing out at the retired neurosurgeon, Trump mocked a story in question about Carson’s attempting to stab a friend or relative and the knife blade breaking.

"It hit the belt. And the knife broke. Give me a break," Trump said at an Iowa rally Thursday night.

He added: "He hit the belt buckle? Anybody with a knife want to try it on me? Believe me it ain't gonna work.”

Carson told Couric this morning that he would reveal the identity of the friend or relative he attempted to stab "if media will be honest and fair."

On global affairs, Carson said that if he were in a meeting with Russian Vladimir Putin, he would tell him that "we are a peaceful nation, but we are not a marshmallow."

And when asked about the Confederate flag, he said that some "find it to be something they are proud of," adding that it "doesn’t bother me."
