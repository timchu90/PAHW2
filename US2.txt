An Illinois appellate court has affirmed former police officer Drew Peterson's murder conviction and sentence in the 2004 death of his third wife.

The third district court's Friday ruling says evidence against the retired sergeant was sufficient to show he killed Kathleen Savio, whose body was found in her suburban Chicago home's bathtub. The court upheld Peterson's 38-year sentence, meaning he won't be paroled until 2047.

Peterson attorney Steve Greenberg says he'll continue to appeal.

Savio's death was initially ruled accidental, but the case was reopened after Peterson's fourth wife disappeared in 2007. Peterson remains a suspect in that case but has denied harming both women.

He's also scheduled to stand trial on charges he solicited an inmate to kill Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow, who prosecuted the Savio case.
