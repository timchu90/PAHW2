Police say home video surveillance cameras caught images of the man who investigators believe broke into an Indianapolis home and fatally shot a pastor's pregnant wife.

City police Capt. Craig Converse said during a Friday news conference that police haven't identified the hoodie-wearing suspect in 28-year-old Amanda Blackburn's death.

Converse says Blackburn's husband, Davey, left their home about 6:10 a.m. Tuesday and that the burglar might have seen that as an opportunity to break into the house.

Maj. Eric Hench says a neighbor heard a possible gunshot about 6:45 a.m. and that home video shows a dark SUV speeding from the neighborhood.

A family spokesman says Blackburn was 13 weeks pregnant and that the Blackburns also have a 15-month-old son.
